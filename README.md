# XFOIL_auto

The repository is to automatically call XFOIL analysis (developed by Drela[1]). 

The function 'xfoil.m' is written by JoshTheEngineer (www.joshtheengineer.com).

The function 'xfoil_given_geo.m' is for the case in which airfoil geometry is given. Before using the function, please make sure the file of the airfoil geometry exists. In the 'main.m' code, you can see the filename 'Airfoil_coordinate_CST.txt' is provided for the xfoil function.
